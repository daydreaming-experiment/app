Daydreaming is a pilot cognitive science experiment that studies
**mind-wandering** patterns by using smartphones. It takes advantage of *in
vivo* possibilities, that is measurements that are not usually possible in a
lab. Read more at [dayreaming-the-app.net](http://daydreaming-the-app.net).

This experiment is part of the larger
[Science-en-Poche](http://www.iscpif.fr/sep) project, making it easier for
researchers and citizens to develop apps with user input and feedback loops. It
works with [Yelandur](https://github.com/science-en-poche/yelandur) as backend
server to collect data for the experiment. Last but not least, it's free
software (GPLv3).

Any contribution is very welcome! You can get up and running by having a
look at the `CONTRIBUTING.md` document.
